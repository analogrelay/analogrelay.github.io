Phew, I've been posting a lot of forum posts and blogs today trying to tidy up loose ends, because I'm off to Redmond today! I'll be going back to Microsoft for another summer internship, and I'm really excited!<br><br>I'll try to post more later in the week (because I really have to shutdown my computer and pack it up now :P) so keep an eye here, and on my Twitter feed: <a href="http://twitter.com/anurse">http://twitter.com/anurse</a> (follow me?).<br><p></p>
