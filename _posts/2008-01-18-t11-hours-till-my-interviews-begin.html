So, I'm chilling in my hotel in Redmond watching MythBusters (best show ever!) while I await the start of my Microsoft Interviews at 8am tomorrow morning.<br><br>Now, on to things my readers would be interested in :). I'm going to start a series on Extending the Reports Module in the next few days that's going to start by developing a custom Data Source for the module that extracts data from an RSS feed. I'll probably move on to developing a custom Visualizer and even more tutorials.<br><br>I'm also going to try to set up a documentation Wiki for the module and pre-populate it with some basic documentation for Reports 5.0.<br><br>Anyway, now that the holidays are over, I'll be getting back into blogging regularly, so keep an eye on your RSS readers!<br><p></p>
