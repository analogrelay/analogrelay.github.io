<p>After a few delays, version 5.0 of the Reports Module has been released to the Module Release Process. This means that it should be released shortly (though given the time of year, it may take a couple of weeks). I'll be posting some How-To screencasts walking through the new features (and some old ones too) in the next week or so. I'm also working on a full User's Guide to be released shortly.</p>  <p><strong>One important note regarding Reports 5.0:</strong> The module <strong>requires at least v4.6 of the DotNetNuke core</strong>, it will <strong>NOT</strong> run on a previous version of the core. This is because of the new Visualizer and Data Source installers which use the Package Installer introduced in v4.6. I hope to release a version of the module with the installer portions removed which will be referred to as &quot;Version 4.9&quot;.</p>  <p>To give you an idea of what's coming, here's an excerpt from the release notes containing a list of resolved issues in this version (The same list can be found here: <a title="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/project/RoadMap.aspx?PROJID=36" href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/project/RoadMap.aspx?PROJID=36">http://support.dotnetnuke.com/project/RoadMap.aspx?PROJID=36</a>)</p>  <ul>   <li><strong><em>RPT-5634</em> JavaScipt error when first configuring Reports DNN _04.05.01         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; A JavaScript error was occuring on the main settings page, this has been corrected </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-5676</em> HTML Decoding in XSL Visualizer         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Fix through RPT-6514 </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-4698</em> Clean up interface for Reporting Services Visualizer         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Interface for Reporting Services Visualizer has been improved significantly the Visualizer has also been renamed to the &quot;Microsoft ReportViewer Visualizer&quot; </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-5715 </em>Include {databaseOwner} token in upgrade SQL scripts         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Scripts have been corrected </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-5791 </em>Run Reports on Demand         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Reports can now be run &quot;on-demand&quot; rather than automatically on load </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-5806 </em>Support the EnableExternalImages property of ReportViewer control         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; The EnableExternalImages and EnableHyperlink properties are now supported, along with many others (see RPT-4698) </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-3994 </em>Alternate Data Sources         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Data Sources Framework allows Reports to run queries against other Databases (SQL Server, Access, Oracle, etc.) </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-6466 </em>Disable the Use of Parameters while Caching is enabled         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Paramaters are disabled when Caching is enabled due to a serious privacy risk </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-6514 </em>HTML Decoding and Encoding of fields retrieved from database         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Fields can now be individually HTML Encoded and HTML Decoded before being passed to the Visualizer </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-6516 </em>Report Info Pane         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; An info pane displaying the title and description of the report can now be displayed on the main screen </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-6454 </em>Allow Users to specify custom CSS Styles and Classes for the Grid in the Grid Visualizer         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Users can use custom CSS to style the Grid Visualizer </li>    <li><strong><em>RPT-6438 </em>Add a setting to enable/disable Grid Lines in Grid Visualizer         <br /></strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; Grid Lines can now be configured in the Grid Visualizer </li> </ul>  <p>Keep an eye on the blogs for more updates, I'll make sure to post here when the module is released!</p>  <p></p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ddc7a729-54ea-4d20-9c15-6693fe547072" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/DotNetNuke" rel="tag">DotNetNuke</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Reporting" rel="tag">Reporting</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ASP.Net" rel="tag">ASP.Net</a></div>
