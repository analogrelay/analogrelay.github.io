Well, its been a fun summer, but my time at Microsoft is over ...<br><br><br>... for now :).&nbsp; It looks like I'll be coming back full-time come next August, so it's a bittersweet end.&nbsp; I'll miss the people on my team and the interns I've met, but in most cases I'll see them again next year!&nbsp; Keep an eye on this blog, because you can bet I'll be posting when the stuff I worked on goes live!<br><p></p>
