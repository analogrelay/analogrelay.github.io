<p>11:00AM - I look in my backpack to check that the Project Proposal that is due at my PHYS 192 class at 11:30 is still in there</p>  <p>11:01AM - I realize it isn't there, I left it at home</p>  <p>11:02AM - I decide to just reprint it on campus, and relax</p>  <p>11:05AM - I fire up Word and open up the Print Dialog</p>  <p>11:06AM - I discover that the campus print server isn't in my printers list</p>  <p>11:08AM - I locate the campus printing instructions and start setting up the printer</p>  <p>11:10AM - I discover that the printer driver I need isn't included in Windows</p>  <p>11:12AM - I locate the printer driver online and start downloading it</p>  <p>11:15AM - Printer driver installed, I configure the campus printer</p>  <p>11:17AM - Still reasonably calm, I fire up Word again and send my document to the print queue.</p>  <p>11:20AM - After packing up my machine, I walk over to the printing station in the Laptop Lab</p>  <p>11:21AM - I discover a "Out of Order - Sorry for the inconvenience" sign :(</p>  <p>11:25AM - I walk to the other side of the building to another lab and put my printer card in the reader</p>  <p>11:26AM - Spending the last $0.11 on my card, I print my document</p>  <p>11:27AM - Calmly, I grab the printed document and see the following text:</p>  <pre>Error: PCL Protocol Error</pre><br/><br/><p>11:28AM - Scramble to a PC in the computer lab and log in to the machine</p><br/><br/><p>11:30AM - Machine finally logs in, and I fire up Internet Explorer, navigating to my Live Mesh Desktop</p><br/><br/><p>11:31AM - Open up the document from Live Mesh and print it</p><br/><br/><p>11:33AM - Go back to the printer station, and discover that my printer card is empty!</p><br/><br/><p>11:34AM - Walk to the nearby printer card top-up machine and see: "Out of Order - Sorry for the inconvenience"</p><br/><br/><p>11:35AM - After discovering I had no cash, walk to the nearby ATM and withdraw some</p><br/><br/><p>11:37AM - Head to the nearest cafeteria and buy a bottle of water, getting a twoonie ($2 coin, for my non-Canadian readers) in change :)</p><br/><br/><p>11:37AM - Head off to the library on the other side of campus (where the only other printer card top-up machine is, AFAIK)</p><br/><br/><p>11:40AM - Reach the library and stick my card in the machine, pop my twoonie in the slot and top-up my card</p><br/><br/><p>11:41AM - Go over to the library printer and release the printer job</p><br/><br/><p>11:42AM - Pick up the paper and dash over to the lecture hall with my printed proposal in hand</p><br/><br/><p>11:45AM - Arrive, late, and take the only remaining seat, at the front of the class, right next to the pile of proposals from the other students</p><br/><br/><p>11:46AM - Drop my proposal on the pile and sigh in relief</p><br/><br/><p>Seriously, we need a way better campus printing system.&#160; Only two top-up machines on campus?&#160; Why can't I just add funds to my student account online and submit PDFs and DOCs to be printed if I don't want the hassle of configuring the print server?</p><br/><br/><p>Arg...</p>
