<p>Hello avid readers!&#160; It's been over a week since I blogged, I know, but I've been cramming for exams.&#160; The CMPT 376 assignment I mentioned a while ago has finished, so I'm no longer required to blog for grades.&#160; Having said that, after exams, I plan to keep blogging, so keep watching the feed :).</p>  <p>Just to tease you a bit: I've got a cool little ASP.Net MVC side-project well underway that I'm just dying to show off on the blog, so stick around :P</p>  <p>Also, to the Reports Module users out there, 5.1 is very close to being finished.&#160; There may be a surprise new feature in there too.&#160; Details to follow later :D.</p>
