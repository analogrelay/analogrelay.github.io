<p>Back in January, I started <a href="/2009/01/08/WritingABlogForFunAndProfithellipIMeanGrades.aspx" target="_blank">blogging more frequently due to a course I was taking</a>.&#160; As part of that, I started using Windows Live Writer to write all my blog posts.&#160; I use the <a href="http://www.dasblog.info/" target="_blank">DasBlog</a> engine to power my blog, and it supports one of the many blogging APIs that Windows Live Writer uses (I believe it's MetaWeblog).&#160; So, I hooked it up to my blog, and everything just worked!</p>  <p>My favorite feature is the ability to create and save drafts and then publish them on demand.&#160; I have inspiration at the strangest times, and often in large batches, so I end up with a couple ideas of things to blog in a day, and no ideas the next day.&#160; So, I just create a bunch of drafts, get them ready to publish and then publish them over a longer period of time (like say... a day :P).&#160; For example, I wrote this post 5 minutes after the previous post, but I thought it might overload my readers to post it immediately :).&#160; So, I save a draft and post it a bit later (when I don't have anything to blog about :D).</p>  <p>If you have a blog, and it supports one of the blogging APIs, and you're running on Windows, you really should try Windows Live Writer!</p>
