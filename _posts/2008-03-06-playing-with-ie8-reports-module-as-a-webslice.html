<P>So, I?downloaded and installed the IE8 Beta yesterday and decided to play around with <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/features.mspx">WebSlices</A>. I found it really easy to create a simple WebSlice (just apply some CSS Classes) and I decided to try and do this with the Reports Module.</P><br/><P>I was suprised with just how easy it was! I have already created a replacement ViewReports.ascx file that turns every Reports Module into a WebSlice. I've attached the new file here, just replace your existing DesktopModules/Reports/ViewReports.ascx file with it if you want to check it out. Any Visualizer should work, but I've only tried the Grid.</P><br/><P>CAUTION: This is for preview purposes ONLY! This replacement file has NOT been tested in ANY SIGNIFICANT?WAY (other than trying it out once). Back up your existing ViewReports.ascx file BEFORE using this!</P><br/><P>Here's the popup you see when you view a report</P><br/><img border="0" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/webslice_popup_screenshot.png"><br/><P>And here's a screenshot of the WebSlice in action:</P><br/><P><IMG border=0 src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/webslice_screenshot.png"></P><br/><P>Anyway, the file is attached. Try it out on one of your test sites! I'll probably integrate this into an upcoming version in a more configurable way, since it's so easy :).</P><br/><P><A href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/ViewReports.zip">ViewReports.zip (.54 KB)</A></P><br/><P>UPDATE: Changed to a ZIP file</P>
