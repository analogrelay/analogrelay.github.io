<p>The Spring semester at SFU is off to a running start (after a day lost to the snow), and I've already got some homework to do!&nbsp; One of the classes I'm taking is a course titled "Writing for Computer Scientists". The goal is to develop writing skills through practice. Lots and lots of practice :).</p>  <p>Each class (3 times a week), we're required to submit some "writing"?.&nbsp; I use quotes simply to emphasize the freedom of this assignment.&nbsp; All I <strong>have</strong> to do is write a single word, and turn it in each week.&nbsp; Of course, that's not really the point of the assignment ;).&nbsp; One option, provided by the professor, is simply to start a blog (if you don't already have one) and post 2-3 entries per week.&nbsp; Given that I already have a blog which I have had trouble maintaining, I figure this is a good kick in the behind to get myself blogging again.&nbsp; </p>  <p>So, I'll hopefully be blogging more often (at least while my grades depend on it :D).&nbsp; I'll probably stick to the current subject of the blog: observations from an open-source developer on the Microsoft ASP.Net platform.&nbsp; Just in case I start to wander to different topics, I'll make sure to tag appropriately, so my normal readers can subscribe just to the posts they're interested in.</p>  <p>It's time to start blogging for fun and <strike>profit</strike> grades!</p>
