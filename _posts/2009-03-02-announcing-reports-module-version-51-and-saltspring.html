<p>I've been pretty busy with school, and unfortunately have not been able to get going on the many new features I want to implement in the Reports Module.&#160; However, there are a number of bugs in the current version that prevent it from being used with DotNetNuke 5.0.&#160; For this reason, as well as a few other bugs that aren't quite as major, I'm going to be preparing a minor bug-fix release: Version 5.1.</p>  <p>This version will fix the following major issues:</p>  <ol>   <li>Errors when accessing the Extensions page using the module with DNN 5.0 </li>    <li>Many Exceptions are written to the DNN Event Log when the Search Indexer runs over the Reports Module </li>    <li>Duplicate Search Items are added by the Reports Module, causing exceptions to occur when multi-row Reports are indexed </li> </ol>  <p>I will also be making minor tweaks and clean-ups.&#160; However, no new features will be included in this release.&#160; I'm afraid I just don't have the time at the moment (being a full-time student sucks up a lot of time).&#160; Please let me know if there are any bugs you feel are urgent and need to be fixed in 5.1 by posting in the <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Forums/tabid/795/forumid/136/scope/threads/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Reports Module Forums</a>.&#160; (On a side note, I want to remind my readers that the blog comments aren't really the best place to post questions about the Reports Module.&#160; I try to keep an eye out for them, but he forums are the best place to do that!)</p>  <p>Despite my time constraints, I have been doing a little thinking about new features for the Reports Module.&#160; Since it seems to be the "in" thing now-a-days, I've given the next major update to the Reports Module a codename: "Saltspring" and I've been building a small feature list:</p>  <ul>   <li>Minor architecture changes to the Extensions (Data Sources and Visualizers) to improve testability </li>    <li>Major architecture overhaul to the main module to improve testability, and thus quality, of the core module </li>    <li>Investigate replacing the ZedGraph Chart component used by the Chart Visualizer with the new <a href="http://www.asp.net/community/control-gallery/Item.aspx?i=3110" target="_blank">Microsoft Chart Control</a> </li>    <li>Introducing a new Parameters framework which allows users to define custom SQL Parameters for their queries, which pull their value from various different sources (DNN Objects, Query String, Text Fields, etc.)      <ul>       <li>This framework would be extensible, so that new "Parameter Sources" can be installed, just as Data Sources and Visualizers are </li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p>Again, if you have any more ideas, please let me know!</p>
