<p><strong>UPDATE 2: PowerKits requires PowerShell 2.0.&#160; If you're seeing errors regarding the "try-catch" keywords, its because those keywords were added in PowerShell 2.0 and I use them in PowerKits.&#160; Sorry!</strong></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE: It turns out PowerShell 2.0 already contains a feature like this: "Modules."?&#160; See </strong><a href="http://huddledmasses.org/powershell-modules/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more info.&#160; Since it seems to be far superior to PowerKit (which I just hacked together for my own needs), I guess that just leaves this as an interesting exercise :).</strong></p>  <p>I've been a huge fan of Windows PowerShell since it first came out as "Monad" (aka "MSH"?).&#160; Now that its entering version 2.0, which will be built-in to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, I'm getting even more into it.&#160; I've written a Podcast Receiver (PowerCast) and an automated process for converting videos for use on my Xbox 360 (PowerCode).</p>  <p>[The following paragraph is a short intro to PowerShell, feel free to skip it if you're familiar with PoSH]</p>  <p>What is PowerShell?&#160; PowerShell is an object-oriented shell which, IMHO, kicks the pants off of BASH and Perl.&#160; PowerShell is a dynamically-typed scripting language written on the .Net Framework, which gives you full access to every class, method, and property in the framework.&#160; You could write a GUI, Server, heck even a 3D Game in PowerShell (it just might not perform as well as another language).&#160; PowerShell is also an interactive "Read-Eval-Print" loop application which gives you a prompt into which you type commands which are then evaluated and their results printed to the screen (i.e. a standard "Shell" similar to cmd.exe or BASH).&#160; Finally, PowerShell is an embeddable scripting environment which lets any .Net-based application embed the PowerShell scripting language.&#160; However, most people (myself included) are referring to the Shell itself when they talk about PowerShell</p>  <p>Anyway, on to the main purpose of this post.&#160; I started to get frustrated with trying to manage all my scripts and keep them organized.&#160; I was also downloading a lot of useful scripts off of the web, but had to manually place them somewhere in my file-system (let alone managing all the dependencies).&#160; Other scripting environments, such as Ruby, have packaging systems, such as RubyGems, to manage libraries of functionality and publish them for others to download.&#160; So, I thought, why doesn't PowerShell have something like this?</p>  <p>Thus, PowerKits were born.&#160; The concept is simple.&#160; A PowerKit is a directory on your file-system which contains a manifest file "Kit.xml"?.&#160; This file specifies some information such as the paths to various script files, aliases to create, .Net assemblies to load and (in a future version) PowerShell "snap-ins" to load.&#160; After installing a kit (by placing it in one of many, configurable, pre-defined folders), it can simply be enabled using a single PowerShell Command.&#160; For example, to enable the "MyCompany.MyKit" PowerKit:</p>  <pre class="code">Enable-Kit MyCompany.MyKit</pre><br/><br/><p>Enabling a kit loads all the assemblies, script files, etc. into your PowerShell environment, making them available for use.&#160; A Kit can then be disabled similarly using the "?Disable-Kit" command.&#160; Disabling the kit removes all the script files, etc. from the environment (NOTE: .Net assemblies cannot be unloaded without restarting PowerShell, due to a limitation of the .Net Framework).</p><br/><br/><p>PowerKit also supports packaging kits into a ZIP-like format, specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Packaging_Convention" target="_blank">Open Packaging Convention</a> developed by Microsoft for Office 2007 (since the .Net framework has built-in support for that format). These "Kit Archives" can be downloaded and installed using a single command.&#160; Eventually, I plan to add support for installing a kit directly from the web, so you could use a command like this:</p><br/><br/><pre class="code">Install-Kit <a href="http://www.mycompany.com/MyCompany.MyKit.kit">http://www.mycompany.com/MyCompany.MyKit.kit</a></pre><br/><br/><p>Or even this:</p><br/><br/><pre class="code">Install-Kit MyCompany.MyKit</pre><br/><br/><p>And the framework would go out and download the kit and install it, giving PowerShell a true "gems-esque" packaging system.</p><br/><br/><p>To install PowerKit, download the Install-PowerKit.ps1 script from the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/powerkits" target="_blank">CodePlex site</a>, more installation details are in the release notes on that page.</p>
