<p>I know, it&rsquo;s been too long since I blogged, and I won&rsquo;t even bother saying I&rsquo;ll try to blog more (though I will) because hopefully you&rsquo;ll see that for yourself. A lot has happened since I last blogged but the biggest thing is that the ASP.Net Web Stack (which is what we call the out-of-band stuff we ship, like MVC, WebPages, WebAPI and Razor) is now truly an open-source project! We&rsquo;re hosted on CodePlex (<a title="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/" href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/">http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/</a>) and if you want more details, check out Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s awesome <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVC4ASPNETWebAPIAndASPNETWebPagesV2RazorNowAllOpenSourceWithContributions.aspx">post</a> about it.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re open, I&rsquo;ll be able to start talking a little more directly about what we&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s very exciting for us, and to alleviate your worries that open-source means Microsoft isn&rsquo;t working on it anymore, we&rsquo;re still working full-time on our current release and even starting a bit of planning for v.Next.</p>
<p>All that aside, we also released a new version of Razor since I&rsquo;ve blogged and I thought I&rsquo;d give you a quick run-through of the features. In later posts, I&rsquo;ll go over the details of what&rsquo;s changed as well as some new information for those hosting Razor outside of ASP.Net on how to take advantage of those features.</p>
<h3>~/ &ndash; Url resolution made easy, goodbye @Href/@Url.Content!</h3>
<p>One of the most common patterns in MVC Views is this:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src=&rdquo;@Url.Content(&ldquo;~/Scripts/myscript.js&rdquo;)&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>Well, in Razor v2, you can express the same intent with much less code, and it looks much cleaner too:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src=&rdquo;~/Scripts/myscript.js&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>Note the lack of any code transitions! How does this work? It&rsquo;s quite a simple algorithm: Whenever we see an attribute value that starts &ldquo;~/&rdquo;, we treat it like a URL and replace it with a call to <code>@Href</code> (in WebPages) or <code>@Url.Content</code> (in MVC). Note that this is ANY attribute, so if you typed the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;div class=&rdquo;~/Foo&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>We&rsquo;ll treat &ldquo;~/Foo&rdquo; as a URL. We made this choice because we didn&rsquo;t want to limit you to a list of attributes that we think have URLs. Especially when you might want to put URLs in a <code>data-</code> attribute. Imagine using a <code>data-</code> attribute to tell your client-side javascript what the root of your application is:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;html data-root=&rdquo;~/&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>Then you can use jQuery to access this data: <code>$(document).data(&lsquo;root&rsquo;)</code> and use it when making Ajax calls to make sure your app is portable even if it&rsquo;s in a sub-folder.</p>
<p>What if you want to inject code snippets in to your URL? Well that&rsquo;s easy, just treat it like you would if you were injecting code in to other attribute values:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;a href=&rdquo;~/MySite/@Foo/Bar/@Baz&rdquo;&gt;Something!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>I should note that we&rsquo;re actually not doing much special here, the code above is equivalent to the following MVC code in Razor v1:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;a href=&rdquo;@Url.Content(&ldquo;~/MySite/&rdquo;)@Foo/Bar/@Baz&rdquo;&gt;Something!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>So we are just resolving that first portion of the URL and then going back to regular string concatenation for the rest.</p>
<h3>Conditional Attributes</h3>
<p>The other major feature (there are a few others I&rsquo;ll go over in later posts but they are smaller) is Conditional Attributes. I&rsquo;ll freely admit we borrowed this feature heavily from the fantastic <a href="http://sparkviewengine.com/">Spark View Engine</a> written by our very own <a href="http://whereslou.com/">Louis Dejardins</a>.</p>
<p>Have you ever typed code like this in Razor v1?</p>
<pre class="brush: html">@{ var cls = GetClass(); }
&lt;div id=&rdquo;foo&rdquo;@if(cls != null) { &lt;text&gt;class = &ldquo;@cls&rdquo;&lt;/text&gt; }&gt;</pre>
<p>If not, let me explain why you&rsquo;d want to do this. In Razor v1, <code>null</code> was treated the same as an empty string so if you were to have code like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id=&rdquo;foo&rdquo; class=&rdquo;@cls&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>Then if cls was null, we&rsquo;d render</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id=&rdquo;foo&rdquo; class=&rdquo;&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>Eugh! That looks ugly! In Razor v2, the same code would render this:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id=&rdquo;foo&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>Note the missing class attribute? We&rsquo;ve even taken away the leading space! Another feature of this is that we&rsquo;ll also collapse whitespace within the attribute value:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">@{ string foo = null; string bar = &ldquo;bar&rdquo; }
&lt;div id=&rdquo;foo&rdquo; class=&rdquo;@foo @bar&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id=&rdquo;foo&rdquo; class=&rdquo;bar&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>We also special case boolean values. If the expression evaluates to <code>false</code>, we treat it the same as <code>null</code>. If it evaluates to <code>true</code>, we render out the attribute name again. This allows you to write code like the following for checkboxes:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type=&rdquo;checkbox&rdquo; checked=&rdquo;@isChecked&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>If <code>isChecked</code> is <code>true</code>, we render <code>checked=&rdquo;checked&rdquo;</code>, if it&rsquo;s <code>false</code>, we don&rsquo;t render the <code>checked</code> attribute at all.</p>
<p>Finally, we do NOT treat <code>String.Empty</code> ("") like <code>null</code> in this case. If the expression evaluates to an empty string, we WILL render the attribute:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">@{ var foo = ""; }
&lt;div class=&rdquo;@foo&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>Renders:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;div class=&rdquo;&rdquo;&gt;</pre>
<p>The reason for this lies in the difference between <code>null</code> and <code>String.Empty</code>. Null indicates the complete absence of a value, whereas <code>String.Empty</code> is a value, a string of length 0.</p>
<p>In the currently released (Beta) version of Razor, we do this for all attributes. However, in the next release (and, in fact, in the live code on CodePlex) we have entirely disabled the conditional attributes feature for <code>data-</code> attributes. You'll still get the ~/ URL resolution, but we won't remove null values or do fancy tricks with booleans in <code>data-</code> attributes. This was done because those attributes are usually read from JavaScript, so the semantics are different and we wanted to give you full control.</p>
<h3>There&rsquo;s much more!</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a quick summary. I&rsquo;ll be publishing another post soon with even more new features. Then, we&rsquo;ll go in to how Conditional Attributes is implemented and how you can make sure your custom Razor hosts support this feature.</p>
