<p>I was taking a look at a calendar on Monday and realized something... I only have a few more weeks of school left!&#160; I don't graduate until June, but classes finish on April 6th.&#160; As a result, my workload has been growing exponentially :P, so I'm putting my side-projects on hold.&#160; The only exception is my work on version 5.1 of the DotNetNuke Reports Module, which is coming along quickly and should be finished soon.</p>  <p>I went straight from high-school to university, so its been a non-stop 16 years of school.&#160; So, it's going to be a little bit strange when I graduate and actually enter the workforce full-time :).&#160; Still, I've got an awesome job to go to, so I'm still pretty excited.</p>  <p>I have to keep blogging for my CMPT 376 (Writing) course, so I'll keep doing that, but I'm putting pretty much everything else (including "Duh," my toy programming language) on hold for a couple of weeks.&#160; I'll have a bit more time after classes end :).</p>
