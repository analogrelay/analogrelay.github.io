I've been busy with some, paid (and therefore higher priority ;) ), work for the past week or so, which has meant I haven't had time to write up my Module Development in Maverick blog post.&nbsp; I'll try to get that out next week.&nbsp; In the mean time, you can pretty much just take the source (available here: http://github.com/anurse/Maverick) and start playing.&nbsp; Creating a new module is as simple as copying one of the existing folders in the "Source/Web/Maverick.Web/Modules" folder, renaming it, and editing the "Module Application" class inside.&nbsp; There's no registration necessary (thanks to <a href="http://mef.codeplex.com">MEF</a>).<br><br>Have fun, feel free to post questions, and I'll talk to you next week!<br><p></p>
