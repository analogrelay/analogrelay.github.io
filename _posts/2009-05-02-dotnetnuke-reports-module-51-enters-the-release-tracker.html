<p>It took almost a week longer than I said it would, but it's finally done.&#160; Version 5.1 of the DotNetNuke Reports Module is in the DotNetNuke Project Release Tracker.&#160; I'll post some more info over the next week, but for now, here are the release notes:</p>  <h3>Reports Module 5.1 for DotNetNuke 5.0.1</h3>  <p>Required DotNetNuke Version: 5.0.1 or above</p>  <p>The following issues have been resolved in this release of the Reports Module</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=9801&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-9810: Simple URL Parameter system</a> - A simple URL parameter system has been added which allows users to provide a list of QueryString parameters which will be added to the query. The parameter names are in the following format: @url_[QueryString Parameter Name]. Only the parameters specified in the &quot;Allowed URL Parameters&quot; section will be added. </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=5953&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-5953: XSLT Extension Objects</a> - CLR objects can now be provided to the XSLT Visualizer to use as XSLT Extension Objects. These objects must have a parameter-less constructor and MAY (but are not required to) implement the IXsltExtensionObject interface (found in DotNetNuke.Modules.Reports.dll) in order to receive additional context information. </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=7025&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-7025: Search Indexing fails due to an exception</a> - When there is an error in a Data Source, that exception is also thrown by the Search Indexer. Since Reports Module Exceptions were localized, through the Message property, when the Scheduler caught the exception thrown by the module, it would attempt to localize the text and fail (since there is no HttpContext). This has been corrected so that Data Source errors are no longer masked. </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=9543&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-9543: Exception thrown when opening &quot;Manage Add-Ins&quot; page on DNN 5.0</a> - The DotNetNuke Extensions Installer API was moved to a different namespace in 5.0. The Reports module has been updated to reflect this change. </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=8145&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-8145: Reports Module does not release file handle</a> - The HTML Visualizer was opening a StreamReader and using ReadToEnd to load the contents, but not closing the StreamReader. It has been corrected to use System.IO.File.ReadAllText. A similar issue in the XSLT Visualizer was discovered and resolved the same way </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=7237&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-7237: Show Info Pane working incorrectly</a> - The &quot;Show Info Pane&quot;, &quot;Show Controls&quot;, and &quot;Auto Run Report&quot; settings were not being updated if the user is not a Super User, despite the fact that these settings are visible to non-Super Users. This has been corrected in the 5.1 release. </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=7236&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-7236: Critical error when no file name entered for HTML Template Visualizer setting</a> - The HTML Visualizer allowed users to leave the Template file field empty, causing a Critical Error on the view page. The view page has been corrected to avoid causing this error. A similar issue with the XSLT Visualizer has also been corrected </li>    <li><a href="http://support.dotnetnuke.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=7238&amp;PROJID=36">RPT-7238: Show Header field cannot be unchecked</a> - A bug prevented the ShowHeader option from being deselected in the Grid Visualizer. </li> </ul>  <p>Also included is an update for the UDT Data Source for the Reports Module, here are the release notes:</p>  <h3>Forms and Lists Data Source for DotNetNuke Reports 1.1.0 - Release Notes</h3> This is a minor update to the User Defined Table Data Source for the DotNetNuke Reports Module. It has been renamed to the Forms and List Data Source, to match the new project name. Only one minor change is included: The stored procedure used to retrieve the list of Forms and List modules has been removed and replaced with (safe) dynamic SQL to reduce installation overhead. <strong>Requires DotNetNuke Reports 5.0 or above.</strong>   <p>Track the progress of the module through the DotNetNuke Release process here: <a title="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Development/ReleaseManagement/ProjectReleaseTracking/tabid/997/ctl/History/mid/3337/ItemID/394/Default.aspx" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Development/ReleaseManagement/ProjectReleaseTracking/tabid/997/ctl/History/mid/3337/ItemID/394/Default.aspx">http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Development/ReleaseManagement/ProjectReleaseTracking/tabid/997/ctl/History/mid/3337/ItemID/394/Default.aspx</a></p>
