<p>There's been a lot of buzz around the Internet about Quake Live.&#160; I decided to succumb to the hype and try it out and I must say it is pretty cool.&#160; However, a lot of people have heralded this as a unique new way of distributing games, and I have to disagree with that.&#160; Quake Live is no different than any other downloadable game, it just happens to use the browser as a host.&#160; When you go to <a href="http://www.quakelive.com">http://www.quakelive.com</a> for the first time, you log in and wait in a queue.&#160; When you reach the front of the queue, you are prompted to download a plugin (in the form of a Windows Installer MSI file) for your browser.&#160; If the queuing thing sounds very <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/" target="_blank">FilePlanet</a>-esque to you, it certainly does to me.&#160; Then you download the <strike>game</strike> plugin installer and run it (as an Admin).&#160; When it finishes, you have to restart your browser and go back to the website.&#160; After waiting in the queue some more, the game loads up and runs in the browser.</p>  <p>How is this process different from installing a regular desktop game?&#160; You download the installer, run it as Admin, and then start the game.&#160; The only different here is that the game code is running in-process (AFAIK) with the web browser.&#160; It really isn't that different!&#160; Developing a game like this using an existing plugin like Flash or Silverlight (especially since <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/16/update-on-silverlight-2-and-a-glimpse-of-silverlight-3.aspx" target="_blank">Silverlight 3 is supposed to include 3D Acceleration support</a>) would be, IMHO, much more innovative.</p>  <p>About the only thing in Quake Live that differs from a regular desktop game is the use of a streaming installer, which downloads a (relatively) small bootstrapper and then downloads the rest as you play a 10minute training level.&#160; Even that isn't really unique, as <a href="http://www.hanselman.com" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/QuakeLiveReviewAndRantWhyIsThisInteresting.aspx" target="_blank">points out</a>, Guild Wars has included that feature for a while.</p>
