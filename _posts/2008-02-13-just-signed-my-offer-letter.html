<P>Well, I just signed my offer letter so I'm going back to Microsoft for another summer! This time, I'll be working on the ASP.Net team, which is exciting. It's going to be a lot of fun having a chance to contribute to a framework I've been using for the past 2 years (I've almost forgotton what a Windows Form is :P).</P><br/><P>I just thought I'd share that exciting news with my readers. However, I do have a few other updates:</P><br/><OL><br/><LI>The Reports Module 5.0 User Guide is almost "content-complete" so I'll just need to get it formatted properly and it should be ready to go live <br/><LI>I'm starting a Blog series on Developing for the Reports Module. For now, this is going to have to stand in for a full Programming Guide, but hopefully it will be a good starting point for those of you thinking of writing Visualizers or Data Sources.</LI></OL><br/><P>Anyway, look for my first post in that series soon. I'll be crossposting it on my DotNetNuke blog, so feel free to check it out there.</P>
