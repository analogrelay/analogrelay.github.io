<p>As I mentioned in an earlier post about backing up a Zune Library (<a href="/2008/12/11/BackingUpAZuneLibraryForWhenYouReinstallWindows.aspx" target="_blank">Backup a Zune Library...</a>), I wanted to find a way to be able to actually store the Zune library database on a different drive.&#160; I played with the Microsoft Sysinternals "<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx" target="_blank">Junction</a>" tool, which lets you create <em>hardlinks</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Link" target="_blank">Wikipedia on Hardlinks</a>) and managed to get it to work.&#160; Here's the process to do it yourself.&#160; Replace <em>UserName</em> with your Windows user name and <em>D:MusicZuneLibrary</em> with the path to the folder you want to store the database in.</p>  <ol>   <li>Download Junction.exe from here: <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx</a> (replace <em>D:UtilsSysinternalsjunction.exe</em> below with the path you downloaded junction.exe to) </li>    <li>Shut down the Zune software if it is running. </li>    <li>Rename the folder C:\Users\<em>UserName</em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Zune to Zune_backup (just to be safe).&#160; You may encounter a file locking issue, but I found that if I waited a few minutes it worked. </li>    <li>Copy the Zune_backup folder to <em>D:MusicZune</em> and rename it to <em>Library</em></li>    <li>Run the following command:      <pre>D:UtilsSysinternalsjunction.exe Zune D:MusicZuneLibrary</pre><br/>  </li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>That should do it!&#160; Start Zune up again and your library should be up and running.&#160; Now you should be able to reinstall the OS without having to back up the Zune library.&#160; I might try to whip up a PowerShell or Batch file to do this, but don't get too hopeful :).</p>
