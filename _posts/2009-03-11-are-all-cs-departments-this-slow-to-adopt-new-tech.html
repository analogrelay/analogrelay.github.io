<p>Having spent 5 years taking courses in the Computing Science department at Simon Fraser University, I've become pretty familiar with the various web applications used to track course projects, submit assignments, etc.&#160; Over the same five years, I've seen numerous technological changes, both in the "outside world" and within the University.&#160; For example, not too long ago, SFU switched to a central authentication service aptly named "Central Authentication Service" (or <a href="http://www.jasig.org/cas" target="_blank">CAS</a>).&#160; It's a pretty nice service, with a snazzy login screen (below).</p>  <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_6.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="SFU CAS Login Page" border="0" alt="SFU CAS Login Page" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_thumb_2.png" width="644" height="437" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>It's not only snazzy, but a pretty useful system.&#160; I even integrated one of my school projects (an online grade tracking application) with it without any external support.&#160; Let's contrast that with the <strong>current</strong> login screen for "Gradebook"?, an application developed by the CS department and used in most CS courses to track grades</p>  <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_8.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Gradebook Login Page" border="0" alt="Gradebook Login Page" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_thumb_3.png" width="644" height="297" /></a> </p>  <p>Ok, not as snazzy, but here's the really frustrating thing:&#160; My account here is NOT the same as my SFU computing account!</p>  <p>The "Gradebook" system also includes an electronic assignment submission server</p>  <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_10.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="CS Submission Server" border="0" alt="CS Submission Server" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_thumb_4.png" width="644" height="133" /></a></p>  <p>(BTW: This is only a small snapshot of the page)</p>  <p>Sure, it isn't snazzy looking, but it's simple and to the point (+10 points).&#160; However, it comes with a few caveats: I have to use my "Gradebook" account, not my (so-called) "universal" SFU account (-25 points), and ALL submissions must be in ZIP, GZIP or RAR format (-25 points)!&#160; For many of my courses, the electronic submission has been a single file, and the instructor often has to email the students to remind them that they have to wrap their single PDF file (or Word Doc, etc.) in a ZIP file to upload it.&#160; I can understand the benefits as far as storage space, and bandwidth consumption, but wouldn't that be better achieved by simply placing a size restriction and allowing any file to be uploaded?&#160; Plus, when I do login, I get a page with a drop-down list of courses.&#160; Here's the contents:</p>  <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_12.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vibrantcode-res/blogcontent/imported/WindowsLiveWriter/AreallCSdepartmentsthisslowtoadoptnewtec_9F8F/image_thumb_5.png" width="90" height="244" /></a></p>  <p>See that scrollbar?&#160; Yeah... I'm not registered in anywhere near that many courses (the <strong><em><u>one</u></em></strong> course I'm registered in is a few scrolls away), but it would appear the submission server doesn't know that.</p>  <p>It doesn't end with the student interface.&#160; In a course on "Web Information Systems," we were required to develop a web-based application of some sort, and my group chose to build a grade tracking system (partly out of frustration with the current system).&#160; Before starting the project, we organized a meeting with our instructor to find out what his frustrations were with the existing "Gradebook" system used by the department.&#160; He mentioned that instructors had to rebuild the structure of assignments, exams and their relative contributions to the final grade every time they created a course.&#160; He continued to show us a tool he developed which allowed him to create more detailed marks, give comments, and build an email to send off to the student.&#160; He had to build a custom tool to perform tasks which I would consider essential to a modern grade tracking system.&#160; In a few weeks, we hammered out a "school project quality" system running on Ruby on Rails (ASP.Net MVC wasn't out yet :P) which supported all the features we discussed in our meeting with the prof.</p>  <p>Granted, I know it's not as simple to fix as it is to complain.&#160; But, with the tools out there, and the number of open-source and commercial courseware products, I still don't really understand why we're using a system with so many annoying issues...</p>  <p>For the CS students (or recent grads) who read my blog, is my experience atypical?&#160; Or are your school services as out of date as these?</p>
