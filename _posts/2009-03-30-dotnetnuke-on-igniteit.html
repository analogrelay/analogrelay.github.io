<p>Did you know that the largest open-source project on the Microsoft platform was started in Vancouver, Canada?&#160; It's true!&#160; DotNetNuke is the largest Open-Source community in the .Net by downloads (at least).&#160; Since moving to CodePlex (Microsoft's Open-Source hosting platform) in January 2009, DNN has been downloaded over 180,000 times (at time of writing).&#160; This makes it second only to a World Of Warcraft Add-On development studio which has been on CodePlex since Sept 2007 (at least that was the earliest check-in I could find).&#160; Adding that to the all-time download score on SourceForge (the project's previous host) of <strong>4.3 Million downloads</strong>, and you've got the the largest .Net open-source project (and one which I am proud to <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Products/Development/Forge/ModuleReports/tabid/970/Default.aspx" target="_blank">contribute to</a>)!</p>  <p>And here's the great part for us Canucks, DotNetNuke was created right here (by "here"?, I mean where I live :P) in Vancouver!</p>  <p>Microsoft Canada is running a contest called the "Ignite It" award to honour Canadian developers and IT professionals.&#160; DotNetNuke is nominated in the Developer category, and we're looking for your votes!&#160; There's only 2 days left, and we're in the top 5 (which will go on to be judged).&#160; Still, we'd like to be up at number one before voting ends, so here comes the shameless plug :P.&#160; Here's the deal: You can vote once per Windows Live account per day (though there aren't many days left :( ).&#160; It only takes a second to vote, and I've even created a TinyURL to share with your friends: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/dnnigniteit">http://tinyurl.com/dnnigniteit</a></p>  <p>Let's push DNN into the top spot!</p>
