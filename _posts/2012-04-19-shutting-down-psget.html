<p>Hey folks, I wanted to make a quick post to tell you all I'm going to be shutting down work on the PS-Get project. The gallery is being shutdown now and the GitHub Repo will remain open but I do not intend to continue work. There was too much confusion between my project (<a title="https://github.com/anurse/ps-get" href="https://github.com/anurse/ps-get">https://github.com/anurse/ps-get</a>) and PsGet (<a href="http://psget.net/">http://psget.net/</a>). I got a number of people asking me questions about the other and general confusion arose. Also, I'm moving towards a simpler Git-based mechanism for getting my own PowerShell modules (all of which are available at <a href="http://github.com/anurse">http://github.com/anurse</a>) on to all my machines, so I don't need it anymore.</p>  <p>Don't hesitate to use/view/fork my code, but for now I'm done with the project. It was fun to write, but I can't really justify maintaining it anymore.</p>
