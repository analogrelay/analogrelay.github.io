<p>So, as an MSDN subscriber (no, I'm not made of money, Microsoft Interns get a free year-long subscription to MSDN for personal use :P), I had access to the Windows 7 public beta a day early.&#160; I decided to go crazy, since I've been hearing its really stable, and put the latest OS on both my laptop <strong>and </strong>my desktop.&#160; (Well, I actually put Windows 7 Server, aka Windows Server 2008 R2 on my desktop).&#160; So, I figured I'd post my first impressions.</p>  <h3>Installation</h3>  <p>There's not much to say here, Installation is exactly like Windows Vista, only a little faster.&#160; The only new feature is that Windows 7 Setup prompts you to create a HomeGroup, if you want.&#160; HomeGroups are the new networking construct introduced in Windows 7 designed to make it easier to share files and devices between networked computers.&#160; I haven't had a change to check that out yet, so I'll come back to it later.</p>  <h3>Initial Impression</h3>  <p>Besides a stylish new boot screen, in which four coloured dots dance around before combining to form the Windows logo, the boot process is also identical to Windows Vista.&#160; I did find that it booted up much faster than Vista (though I can't make an accurate comparison, since my laptop was getting a bit overloaded).&#160; The new taskbar is very cool, and while it is a bit of a knock-off of the OSX Dock, I think Microsoft has (in typical Microsoft fashion) gone above and beyond the OSX experience.&#160; For example, by hovering the mouse over an icon, a list of all the windows belonging to that application appears.&#160; Even better, applications which directly support Windows 7 can add their own "windows" to this list.&#160; For example, even though I only have one IE8 window open, each tab in that window appears as a separate item in the windows list.</p>  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Taskbar Windows List" border="0" alt="Taskbar Windows List" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_thumb.png" width="716" height="264" /></a> </p>  <p>By hovering over each thumbnail, that window is brought to focus on the screen, and the rest of the windows become "glass"?.</p>  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_4.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Peeking at a Window" border="0" alt="Peeking at a Window" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_thumb_1.png" width="644" height="337" /></a> </p>  <p>(And yes, I did blank out my Windows Messenger buddies list :P).</p>  <p>Jump lists are another cool feature, but I haven't had a chance to explore it much.&#160; Essentially, when you right click, or click and drag up on one of these taskbar icons, a jump list appears.</p>  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_6.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IE8 Jumplist" border="0" alt="IE8 Jumplist" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_thumb_2.png" width="287" height="599" /></a> </p>  <p>In this case (Internet Explorer 8), my history is displayed.&#160; Applications designed for Windows 7, get a lot of control over this list, but applications which are not designed to support it (PowerShell 2.0 for example) just get a simple default list</p>  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_8.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="PowerShell 2.0 Jumplist" border="0" alt="PowerShell 2.0 Jumplist" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17594081/BlogContent/03082011-Import/WindowsLiveWriter/Windows7FirstImpressions_CD0A/image_thumb_3.png" width="298" height="131" /></a> </p>  <h3></h3>  <p></p>  <p>I haven't had much of a chance to explore the rest of the new stuff, so I'll post more later, but my initial impression is that Windows 7 is just plain awesome :).</p>
