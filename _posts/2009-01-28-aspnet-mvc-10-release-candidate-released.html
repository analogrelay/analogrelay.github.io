<p><a href="http://www.haacked.com" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> (program manager on the ASP.Net MVC team) just posted a <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/01/27/aspnetmvc-release-candidate.aspx" target="_blank">blog post</a> about the new Release Candidate of the MVC framework.&#160; Since I got a chance to work on the MVC framework team as an intern this summer (and I'm going back full-time this summer), I'm pretty excited about the news.&#160; When this goes RTM, it'll be the first time code that I wrote will be part of a full shipping Microsoft product!&#160; </p>  <p>So download the binaries from <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.Net</a> or check out the source code on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=MVC&amp;referringTitle=Home" target="_blank">CodePlex</a> and have some fun!</p>  <p>Also, check out <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie's post on the new features</a>.&#160; He shows off one of the features that, I think, makes ASP.Net MVC more compelling than Ruby on Rails: Powerful first-party tooling support.</p>
